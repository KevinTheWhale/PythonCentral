    "(c) (4 points) Use either NumPy or Scipy to generate a game-of-life board of size $10 \\times 10$ in which each cell is a Bernoulli(p) random variable. That is, assume that cells are independent and that each value is 1 with probability p or otherwise 0. Start with p=0.5. Look at your initial board (you don't have to show the image). Show the visualization of the board after 100 steps of evolution. Repeat this process for a number of different random seeds (at least 10 different seeds). You do not have to show us your plots (you can only show one plot at a time per Juypter Notebook cell with the `print_board()` function). What happens if you start with a different (larger, smaller) value of p? Please describe what you observe. "
