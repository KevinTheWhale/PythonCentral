That is, define the object you want to feed into your function (e.g., x=[2,3,5,1,1,2,0,5,9,0,8,4,3,2] for Problem 1 or string = \"Happy CODING!\" for Problem 2) and write code to do what the problems is asking you do to. Then later, make the object (here x or string) the variable of your function and add a return statement. \n",

    "In all problems below, please make sure to comment your code sufficiently well so that the grader can follow what you are doing with ease. If you do not know how to code the solution to a problem, you can get partial credit by providing a description of the algorithm you intended to implement in English (in form of an itemized list, for example).
