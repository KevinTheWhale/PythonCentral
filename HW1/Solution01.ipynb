    "Much of data science these days is based on text data. The text to be analyzed may be literature or postings on social media. The tasks to be performed could be sentiment analysis (trying to guess whether the writing is \"pro\" or \"con\" on a certain issue) to automatically detecting postings by Malicious bots. However, before you can perform any kind of machine learning procedure on a text, you have to first learn how to \"clean\" the text. That usually means removing all non-text elements and sometimes also removing filler words such as \"the\", \"it\", \"and\" etc. After that, what is usually analyzed is the frequency with which certain words appear and most often actually not the *order* in which they appear. \n",
